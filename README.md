- üè• **Doctor Recommendations**: Suggests nearby doctors based on user location in Chennai
- ‚≠ê **Rating System**: Recommends doctors based on ratings and location
- üîÑ **Model Selection**: Switch between different LLM models (Llama 3, Mistral, DeepSeek)
- üß© **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust chunk size and overlap for knowledge base processing

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: Frontend interface
- **AWS Bedrock**: Provides LLM capabilities (Llama 3, Mistral, etc.)
- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM applications
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python
- **Semantic Search**: Uses embeddings to find relevant medical information

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrabhasMahanti123/MedGPT.git
cd MedGPT
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your AWS credentials (options):
   - Create a `.env` file with your AWS credentials
   - Configure them in `app.py`
   - Use AWS CLI to configure credentials

## Configuration

1. Update the `knowledge_base.txt` file with your medical information
2. Update the `doctor_list.txt` file with doctor information in the format:
   ```
   Doctor Name | Specialty | Area | Rating
   ```

3. AWS credentials can be set in the `.env` file:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=your_region
```
